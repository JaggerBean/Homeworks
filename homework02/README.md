# Mars Rover Meteorite Samples 


## WHAT IT IS:

This folder contains all of the files that detail the total time required for a mars rover to gather data of meteorites on Mars..
These scripts work with .json files by creating one and reading its data into a python file.


## WHAT DO THE SCRIPTS DO:

lat-lon.py creates a file called sites.json every time it is ran.
the sites.json file contains 5 positions of meteorites.
travel-time.py calculates the time that the robot would need to visit and sample all of the meteorites in sites.json.


## HOW TO RUN IT:

the order in which to run this code is first run lat-lon.py and then run travel-time.py.
The code will give you all of the information on how many trips the robot took and the time required to complete the samplings
